    "hornet": "Holocene Climate Reconstruction for the Northern Hemisphere Extra-tropics",
    "hornet_desc": "This is the central project of the <i>Davis Group</i>. My contributions to this project are the development of new methods on how we can reconstruct the climate from hundreds of thousands of pollen samples, as well as further analysis of the dataset, e.g. the reconstruction of atmospheric teleconnection patterns, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Another task is to develop a web-viewer in order to share our database with the rest of the scientific community.",

    "psyplot": "Python framework for interactive data visualization",
    "psyplot_desc": "psyplot is a cross-platform open source python project that mainly combines the plotting utilities of matplotlib and the data management of the xarray package and integrates them into a software that can be used via command-line and via a GUI. <br> The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a fast, attractive, flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially an interactive visualization and analysis of data. <br> Through various plugins psyplot visualizes georeferenced climate model data on rectangular and unstructured grids, regressions, stratigraphic diagrams and more. <br> Examples are available at <a href=https://psyplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#examples>psyplot.readthedocs.io</a>.",

    "straditize": "A software for a semi-automatic digitization of pollen diagrams or other types of stratigraphic diagrams using the command line or a graphical user interface.",
    "straditize_desc": "STRADITIZE (Stratigraphic Diagram Digitizer) is an open-source program that allows stratigraphic figures to be digitized in a single semi-automated operation. It is designed to detect multiple plots of variables analyzed along the same vertical axis, whether this is a sediment core or any similar depth/time series. <br> More at <a href=https://straditize.readthedocs.io>straditize.readthedocs.io</a>.",

  "career":{
    "description": "During my Bachelor I realized that I really want to do research on how our world is evolving. This wish was even stronger than my joy about the beauty of maths in physics. I have strong theoretical skills so I started coding and to develop climate models. This is now the way to go for me and since then I rejoice in data analysis and visualization. We can extract so much new knowledge out of these large data sets through visual and statistical exploration. Hence I am always keen to learn and develop new techniques and to share them with others.",
